### Reverse Function for Singly Linked List

**File**: `Reversell.cpp`

**Function**: `void List::reverse()`

**Purpose**:  
The `reverse` function inverts the order of the nodes in a singly linked list. This function enables the list to be traversed in reverse order from its current state, which is particularly useful in scenarios where the order of elements needs to be reversed without recreating the entire data structure.

**Description**:  
This function works by reversing the direction of the `next` pointers of all nodes in the list. It iteratively adjusts the links between nodes from one direction to the opposite, effectively reversing the list.

**Implementation Details and Steps**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
   - `prev` is initialized to `nullptr` as it will eventually become the new tail of the list, which does not point to any other node.
   - `curr` starts at `head`, pointing to the first node in the list.
   - `next` is used to temporarily store the next node in the list as links are being adjusted.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The function enters a loop that continues until `curr` becomes `nullptr`, indicating the end of the list has been reached.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `next` is assigned the value of `curr->next`, which is the node following `curr`.
     - `curr->next` is then set to `prev`, effectively reversing the link.
     - `prev` is updated to `curr`, moving it forward in the list.
     - `curr` is updated to `next`, also moving it forward and preparing for the next iteration.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop completes, `head` is set to `prev`. Since `curr` is `nullptr`, `prev` points to what was the last node of the list, which is now the first node of the reversed list.

**Usage**:
- This function can be called on any instance of the `List` class to reverse the order of its nodes. It modifies the list in place and does not require any additional memory proportional to the size of the list, making it memory efficient.

**Example**:
```cpp
int main() {
    List l;
    l.push_front(3);
    l.push_front(2);
    l.push_front(1);
    l.push_back(4);
    l.push_back(5);
    l.reverse();  // Reverses the list
    l.print();    // Outputs: 5 4 3 2 1
    return 0;
}
```

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the list is properly initialized and managed. It does not handle specific edge cases related to memory management outside of its scope, such as handling of dynamic memory elsewhere in the program.
