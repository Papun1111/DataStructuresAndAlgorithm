### Middle Function for Singly Linked List

**File**: `List.cpp`

**Function**: `void List::middle()`

**Purpose**:  
The `middle` function is designed to find and output the middle element of a singly linked list. This is useful for scenarios where you need a quick reference to the central point of a list, which can be pivotal in algorithms that require splitting the list or analyzing it in halves.

**Description**:  
This function employs the two-pointer technique, specifically the "tortoise and hare" approach, where two pointers progress through the list at different speeds. This approach efficiently identifies the middle of the list with a single pass.

**Implementation Details and Steps**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, are both initialized to the head of the list.
   - The `slow` pointer moves one node at a time.
   - The `fast` pointer moves two nodes at a time.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The loop continues as long as `fast` is not `nullptr` and `fast->next` is not `nullptr`, ensuring that the `fast` pointer can safely make two jumps without accessing beyond the end of the list.
   - In each iteration:
     - `slow` moves to the next node (`slow = slow->next`).
     - `fast` moves two nodes forward (`fast = fast->next->next`).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - When `fast` (the quicker pointer) reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle node of the list due to its half-speed progression.
   - The value of the middle node is then output to the console.

**Usage**:
- This function is particularly useful in scenarios requiring the central division of the list, such as in divide-and-conquer algorithms or when needing to balance data structures dynamically.

**Example**:
```cpp
int main() {
    List l;
    l.push_front(3);
    l.push_front(2);
    l.push_front(1);
    l.push_back(4);
    l.push_back(5);
    
    l.print();  // Outputs: 1 2 3 4 5
    l.middle(); // Outputs: 3
    return 0;
}
```

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the list has at least one node and does not handle the printing of results for empty lists. If the list has an even number of nodes, it will output the higher middle node (e.g., in a list of four nodes, it will output the third node).
